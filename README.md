# DBL Works React Native code challenge

In this task you are required to build out a simple Expo/React Native application, enabling a user
to find and book an appointment.

You have been provided with a simplistic Expo set up utilising NativeBase UI elements.

## Quick start

```shell
yarn install && yarn start
```

Ensure you are using _at least_ Node 14.x (ideally higher).

Once Expo has started, press `a` or `i` to open an `android` or `ios` simulator respectively.
